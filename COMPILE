# Fireflies v2.08

TO COMPILE/INSTALL:
type:
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure [--with-bindir=PATH_TO_YOUR_XSCREENSAVER_HACK_DIR]
	[--with-confdir=PATH_TO_YOUR_XSCREENSAVER_CONFIG_DIR]
    make
    make install
    ./add-xscreensaver PATH_TO_YOUR_XSCREENSAVER_FILE

NOTES for Linux:
The default installation directory for fireflies is /usr/lib/xscreensaver.
The default installation directory for fireflies.xml (the xscreensaver
config file) is /usr/share/xscreensaver/config.  If yours differ from this
(as it almost certainly will), you need to run ./configure with the
--with-bindir and/or --with-confdir options to tell it where to install.
Alternatively, you could just copy the binary and .xml file to the right
places yourself.
To use with xscreensaver, you must add the fireflies entry to your
~/.xscreensaver file.  ./add-xscreensaver does this for you.  Just run
    ./add-xscreensaver PATH
where PATH would usually look like ~/.xscreensaver

TO INSTALL (windows):
If you want the standalone program (for which you need SDL, see below),
run "./configure --disable-screensaver".  Copy the 'fireflies.exe' program
to wherever you want to put it.
If you want the screensaver, configure and compile as usual (screensaver is
the default).  By default, "make install" will put fireflies.scr in your
C:\Windows\ directory, which is where it should be.  Leave it there.  You
can set it up by changing your Display Properties (right click on the
desktop), and selecting 'fireflies' from the pulldown menu.  Clicking on
Settings will open up a configuration window.

NOTES:
This program uses the libgfx graphics library (included with this package)
for basic vertex and rotation processing, available from
http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/libgfx.html

Requirements:
    openGL and GLU (available from www.opengl.org)

Optional:
    SDL (available from www.libsdl.org)
	- SDL will allow you to run fireflies as a standalone program and
	  let you do cool things like pause and move the camera, and
	  trigger major modes by pressing number keys [0-6]  If you don't
	  have it, fireflies will only be able to draw to the root window
          (ie, as a screensaver), and will not respond to input.
    Linux only: glX for xscreensaver support
